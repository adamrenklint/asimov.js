# Changelog

## 0.17.0

  - **Released ?**
  - Simplified how data is passed to template helpers, with breaking changes to existing template helpers using ```self.opts()```, which is removed. Instead you always get params and block callbacks in the function arguments.
  - Fixed issues with the consistency and data available in textfiles and templates, now enforces defaults [#192](https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimov.js/issues/192)
  - ```pages.filter()``` and ```pages.childrenOf()``` now takes an options object, which can be used to filter, sort and slice the results [#175](https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimov.js/issues/175)
  - Define ```options.sortBy``` as an attribute key to sort pages by that attribute
  - Use ```options.reverse``` or ```options.order = "DESC"``` to reverse the order of pages
  - ```options.limit``` and ```options.offset``` also works to slice the array of models
  - All the above options are also available in the ```{{#children}}``` helper, for example using ```{{#children limit=5 offset=10}}```
  - ```{{#pages}}``` block helper will iterate over all your pages, and also takes all the options above

## 0.16.1

  - **Released Friday April 11th, 2014 @ 8.40am**
  - Fixed a regression in the CollectionEvents initializer, which would prevent templates to be parsed for dependencies to watch for changes

  - Default computed page properties are ```isHomepage```, ```isVisible```, ```isNotFoundPage```, ```hasChildren``` and ```childCount``` [#78](https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimov.js/issues/78) [#79](https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimov.js/issues/79) [#81](https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimov.js/issues/81) [#82](https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimov.js/issues/82)
